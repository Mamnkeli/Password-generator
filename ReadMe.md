Run the script:

python password_generator.py

Usage
When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the desired password length. Make sure the length is greater than 6 and less than or equal to 12 characters.

If the input is valid, the script will generate a random password and display it.

You will be asked if you want to try again. If you choose 'Y', the script will generate another password with the same or different length as per your input. If you choose 'N', the script will exit.

If you enter an invalid option or an invalid password length, the script will provide appropriate feedback and allow you to try again.
